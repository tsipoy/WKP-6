# WKP6 - Hungry Student Restaurant

1. The structure of your project.
First, I created the html and after that, and then, the javascript.
For the js: 
First, I grabed elements that I might need from the html. 
Second, I generate the list of food using map() so that it will be seen in the in the browser. 
I couldn't generate most of requirement so I did the modal.
  
1. If you had more time.
I would like generating:
the prices of each meal option
add a meal to the cart
filter the list to see only the vegetarian meals, or only the spicy ones
and, generating the total bill

1. I couldn't really learn because I hardly managed to code all of it.

1. This all project are all challenging for me. When I watched the video and listened your explaination I understand but when I did the the project, I was confused.

1. I think, I need more practice and I need to be really focused during class. Though, I need more explanation about filter.
